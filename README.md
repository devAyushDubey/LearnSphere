# LearnSphere

Problem Statement - The pandemic caused further shocks to the system with schools forced to shut down during the lockdown period, and the transition of students and teachers to online teaching-learning. In India, around 250 million students were affected due to school closures at the onset of lockdown induced by COVID-19.

Rural and Urban education has been severely affected because of unavailability of proper education platforms. Many of the Pathshalas, Aanganwaadis and public schools are forced to move towards a non-interactive communication via whatsapp groups. So to overcome this solution we are presenting our education platform - LearnSphere

Features -

1) LearnSphere is an android application cum platform which focuses on 3 major crowds. One is student, second is faculty and third is parent.

2) For students LearnSphere sagar offers -

   a) Subject Section

   b) Quiz Section - (Normal and Gamified Version) In gamified version students will be attempting quiz in a gamified version so his/her time on our platform becomes enjoyable too. Our Gamified version has the power to transform a boring quiz to an interactive activity. Game Themes -

   Fly High

   Space Hunt

   Dino assist

  c) Attendance, Profile, Calendar, Notices section are also available for the students.

  d) Settling up on pdfs is definitely not what we want students to do, so for this we are presenting - Augment Reality based education content, where a student can augment edu content and can avail 3D visualisation for a better understanding. eg. Solar System , Season Change , Chemistry

  e) We are also presenting our own platform currency which is called as Vidya Coins. On every attempt of quiz activity of the student, he/she will be rewarded some coins which can be used later on to unlock some of the features in the app itself. This feature targets to keep the activity of students high in the platform as spending time in VidyaSagar is way more fruitful than spending time in any Social Media Platform.
